Parsepples, a Parslet-like parser for C++
=========================================

So yeah, while digging down on parsers I think writing something cool would be a good thing
to make some experience, it's been some time since I last wrote something in C++, so here we go.

As the title says, Parsepples is inspired by [Parslet](http://kschiess.github.com/parslet/),
a really really cool parsing tool for Ruby.

This stuff will be using C++0x, because I didn't try to use it yet, so this is a good chance to
learn some new stuff :)
